# Ian Currie Sedano

### Renaissance developer


## Introduction

I am a well-rounded professional who is technically oriented. I have had varied experiences throughout my life and have been exposed to many different people and cultures. I have gathered many skills, from artistic to technical, but every road of my interest has led me to software development.

I am not afraid to get stuck in. Whether that takes the form of rolling up my sleeves and cleaning up a spill, diving into a highly technical manual or doing something outside my responsibilities. If it needs to be done to get where we want to be, I am willing to do it.

I am seen as humble, trustworthy, and patient. My leadership style is based on mutual understanding and co-operation. I believe that if everyone fully understands what the goals are, progress arises naturally.


## Professional goals

I would like to be able to work with many aspects of the development cycle, the full-stack, design philosophy, maintenance and business.

I would like to work for a company where diversity is valued, and yet where there is a very large overlap of values and objectives. Where mistakes are made and learnt from. Where I can be held accountable, but also be given freedom to think and work.

I want to get stuck into a **Junior Software Development** position as soon as possible to solidify my skills and start contributing to software at a professional level. I believe I can move up from a Junior position very quickly, my goal is to be able to manage and mentor a small team of developers within 5 years.


## Soft Skills

* Able to clarify goals and missions, getting everyone on the same page and pulling in the same direction.
* Able to mediate and understand people, able to lead and able to serve.
* Able to think and solve problems laterally and creatively.
* Not afraid to start-again if there is a better way.
* Able to finish projects and not let "feature-creep" take over.

## Significant Experiences

* Developing a way of working with IT from the ground up.
	* A slow start persuading colleagues (many of whom were technologically adverse) by **evangelizing** the benefits and talking one-on-one to understand the resistance.
	* I **demonstrated and taught software** such as Dropbox, Google Sheets, Google Docs, SQL. I demonstrated what was possible with **scripts** in VBA or Python.
	* I **piloted** solutions (out of my own pocket) from adopting Dropbox, to paying developers to consult with and explore options.
	* **Incremented** progress slowly by **introducing** behaviours and technologies that lead to the final solution.
	* Eventually **implementing** a server, database and touch-screen and bar-code interface in the factory which has been in use now for 5 years.

* Become the expert in complicated **logistics** projects.
	* On own **initiative** looked into the **technicalities** of customs and shipping **procedures**, from vehicle **specifications** to **legal** requirements.
	* Was **organized** enough to manage and present all the data required, update all involved parties, and keep things moving. Excel, ERP, CAD

* Discovering VBA through Excel.
	* I initially started using Excel to manage all my data and loved it.
	* I had taken some programming classes but when I **taught myself** how to program things that were really useful to my everyday work, something clicked in me and have since seen an acceleration in my learning and abilities.

* Becoming the IT expert wherever I end up.
	* I was tasked with web development and deploying websites.
	* IT **support** and **troubleshooting**.
	* **Building** desktops, **repairing** and **upgrading** laptops.
	* **Teaching** and **coaching** all levels of competence.

## Q & A

### What are your main work tools (IDEs, Text editors, email clients, Excel...) and how do you used them? (plugins, configuration, tricks)?

My preferred development environment is a combination of Sublime Text 3 with various plugins and Visual Studio Code. I use Windows Subsystem for Linux for all Linux tasks.

I use Gmail as a "back-end" and if the account is not very active, for advanced searches and filters. For my day to day use I use Thunderbird with folders which I organize in such as way that it serves as part of a to-do list. I prefer keeping things in plain text as much as possible.

I track my tasks with a combination of my physical notebook that I carry everywhere, a txt file that I use with the Sublime Text plugin PlainTasks. Recently I have also used Trello and Github projects to organize tasks within a team.

I keep everything synchronized between systems with Git and Dropbox. Everything I write is on the cloud. Many of the utility programs I use are portable and live within Dropbox. If I can save configurations online, like Sublime, they are pushed to all my devices.

I am a big fan of open-source software.

See my article detailing all the programs I set up on my new computer.


### What online resources (webpages, blogs, apps, forums, etc) do you use to carry out your work?

While working:
I like to go straight to the official documentation of whatever tool I am using and have that open. Wikipedia is also very helpful.

Failing that I do a quick Google keyword search which will usually take me to a forum somewhere, often StackOverflow.

Failing that I will usually post on StackOverflow or a more specialized forum. Khan Academy is good for reviewing mathematics.

At other times:
I like to listen to various podcasts on coding and watch Youtube videos on software development, new technologies, lectures from congresses and universities, crazy projects people have come up with. 


### What new technologies and/or tools catch your attention and why?

I am very interested in Terraform and the whole movement behind infrastructure as code. I believe this is an important frontier for programmers everywhere.

I am also of course interested in General AI as it represents for me one of the dreams of programmers everywhere. It is like the pursuit of the unifying theory for physicists.


### Is there a technology company that has caught your attention because they are doing things well?

I am pleasantly surprised that Microsoft are moving strongly into Open Source territory. Visual Studio Code is a great piece of software and their integration with Github I believe has been great for them and their products. They are also integrating Linux functionality via WSL which is also fantastic.

I also admire Gruntwork.io who are greatly developing the "infrastructure as code" movement, while also Open Sourcing a lot of their work.

### How do you try and keep your knowledge and professional skills up to date?

I like to absorb new information and new perspectives, it is what keeps me motivated. I always enjoy having personal projects to develop different skills. I also like to write about processes, talk, discuss and debate practices and philosophies. I like to learn from people by asking and observing.

### Do you tend to share your knowledge somewhere (posts, forums, open-source contributions, public talks)?

The coding school I went to has a Slack channel and a Forum, I always try and answer questions there and help steer new coders in the right direction.
Pythontutor is a site where I often help people with their Python code.
I try and answer questions I can in StackOverflow, though there are many very experienced people there and am usually late! Though my answers for VBA have sometimes been accepted.
I also have a personal website which I use as a blog for many subjects, a repository for installation or configuration instructions that are shared publicly, or as a showcase for public projects.

### Has there been a task or project you've done during your professional career that you are particularly proud of? 

I am proud of the time tracking solution I slowly developed with no outside help, developing a basic architecture from scratch, and for it to be successful.

### Has there been a task or project you've done during your professional career that you would have liked to have done in a different way?

The same time tracking solution. If I could go back with the knowledge I have now, I would have been able to make sounder design decisions, have more confidence in my instinct, and been able to deliver a far better product.

### What qualities and know-how do you think a good professional in your role should have.

A sound technical and logical mind. An experimental approach. Empathy and imagination. Good communication skills. Being able to value decisions from a "big picture" perspective but also be able to get stuck into "local battles"

### What abilities and values do you think a good leader should have?

They should be able to listen to people, understand them and validate their thoughts and feelings. They should also have a strong vision and be able to create belief and enthusiasm around that vision.

They should value humanity, in all its facets, they should believe in progress.

### What would the ideal team look like? One which you would feel proud to be a part of.

A team where everyone is working towards the same goal. Where differences can be suspended while the next immediate steps are made. Where everyone helps each other grow and be better. Where learning is valued and treasured. Where a basic respect is maintained.

### What kind of company do you want to work for? What would it be like?

A company that values innovation and contribution. That documents well and is interested in lasting solutions. Where a collective effort pays off to the collective. Where loyalty and hard work are valued. Where fairness is more common than injustice. In a open and transparent company, but without losing a sense of direction, or having its goals drowned out by too many contrasting viewpoints or responsibilities. Where meetings are productive and short, not too long, not absent or too frequent. Where a life-work balance is promoted and valued as something that will increase productivity in the long run.

### What would a company for which you do NOT want to work be like?

A company that lags behind technologically. That has a strict hierarchy based on nepotism. Where meetings are long, tedious, and where humiliation is often practiced. Where the bottom-line is everything and employee satisfaction or life-work balance is ignored. Where fear is employed as a motivational tool.

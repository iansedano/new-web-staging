<pre class="content">

I am Ian. I like to learn,
about all the things.
To build things, and thereby,
learn more -
thats why I work in tech.
I also sometimes make music,
cook, play go,
daydream about being a taoist.
I also play with my dog,
dogs are too good for this world
and we don't deserve them.
